 <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-align: center;">How It is played</h2>
 Cricket is played between two teams, each consisting of 11 players. The game is played on a circular or oval field with a 22-yard-long pitch in the center. One team bats while the other bowls and fields. The objective is for the batting team to score as many runs as possible, while the bowling and fielding team tries to dismiss the batsmen and limit runs.
<br>
A match begins with a coin toss to decide which team will bat or bowl first. The batting team has two batsmen on the field at a time. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets or by hitting it to the boundary for four or six runs. The bowlerâ€™s goal is to dismiss the batsman by hitting the stumps, catching the ball in the air, or other methods.
<br>
The teams switch roles when 10 out of the 11 batsmen are out, or after a set number of overs, depending on the format. The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. Cricket is played in different formats, such as Test matches, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20), each with varying lengths and rules. <br> <br>
 <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-align: center;">The advantage and disadvantage of Cricket</h2> 
 Cricket has several advantages. It promotes physical fitness by improving stamina, hand-eye coordination, and concentration. The sport encourages teamwork, as players need to cooperate both in the field and while batting. It also offers social benefits, bringing people together through local clubs, tournaments, and international events. Cricket requires strategic thinking and mental focus, enhancing players' decision-making and problem-solving skills. Additionally, it can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels.
<br>
However, cricket has some disadvantages. The game can be time-consuming, especially in formats like Test cricket, which can last for several days. This might make it difficult for people with busy schedules to participate. Cricket also has a high injury risk, especially in bowling, as fast bowlers and fielders may experience strain or accidents. Weather conditions, like rain, can disrupt matches, leading to delays or cancellations. Furthermore, cricket requires specialized equipment like bats, balls, and protective gear, which can be costly.
