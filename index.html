 Football is played between two teams of 11 players on a rectangular field. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent’s net. The game starts with a kick-off from the center circle, and players can move the ball by dribbling, passing, or shooting. Only the goalkeeper is allowed to use their hands within their penalty area. The match lasts for two 45-minute halves, with a 15-minute halftime break. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins. If the score is tied, extra time or a penalty shootout may occur. <br> <br>
 <h2 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); text-align: center;">The advantage and disadvantage of football</h2> 
 Football has several advantages, such as improving physical fitness by boosting endurance, strength, and cardiovascular health. It also fosters teamwork and communication, as players must work together to succeed. The sport offers social benefits, allowing players to make new friends and be part of a community. Mentally, football helps improve focus, discipline, and decision-making. It’s an exciting game, full of action and goals, making it fun to play and watch. <br> <br>

However, football also has some disadvantages. The risk of injury, such as sprains or concussions, is higher in contact sports like football. The game can be time-consuming, with training sessions and matches taking up a lot of hours. The pressure to perform, particularly in competitive environments, can cause stress. Additionally, playing football requires access to a field and proper equipment, which might not always be available.
